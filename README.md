# Text-Summarization-with-Flask

Text summarization refers to the technique of shortening long pieces of text. The intention is to create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document. Automatic text summarization is a common problem in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP). Machine learning models are usually trained to understand documents and distill the useful information before outputting the required summarized texts.
